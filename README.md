# DiskNet

The repo is the official implementation for our  paper: "Predicting Long-term Dynamics of Complex Networks via Identifying Skeleton in Hyperbolic Space‚Äù (KDD 2024). 



## Overall Architecture

DiskNet: (1) Hyperbolic Renormalization Group, which identifies the representation and skeleton of network dynamics; (2) Neural Dynamics on Skeleton, which models the dynamics of super-nodes on the skeleton; and (3) Degree-based Super-Resolution, which lifts the predicted values of super-nodes to the original nodes.
